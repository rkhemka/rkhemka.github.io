				Business Exchange represents an idea of project based on business
				professional interaction with client. The idea is to built a system
				through which business professional can manage their appointment on
				their mobile devices while it is also beneficial for clients as it
				saves their time of interaction which involves visiting the client,
				scheduling appointment, as everything can be done through
				application. Business professionals considered for this project are
				charted accountant, doctors, plumbers and mechanics. The idea is
				implemented using android. Publish paper at IC-CSOD the paper is
				available on Page 384-388</p>

			<h4>Santander Bank</h4>
			<p>Customer satisfaction is the most important aspect for
				organizational success. Benchmarking to be the leader in
				competitive market requires focus on total customer satisfaction.
				The organizations should have a constant check over the degree to
				which customers are satisfied. The goal of this competition was to
				predict if customers are satisfied or not with their banking
				experience. My solution is based on applying different classifier
				training model and then predicting the results for testing data.
