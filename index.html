						</li>
						<li>This assessment are used by student during their
								courses of Special Education and counselling which are issued to students on weekly rentals.	
						</li> 
						<li>
							For this project I built a filly functional web based inventory management system using <i>Spring MVC</i> 
							which efficiently manages more than 500 students records per semester.
						</li>
						<li>My project is currently hosted on university server.</li><br>

						about ticket status through email notification.
					</li>
					<li>
						This was my academic project for Spring 2018, The development of this
						project was divided into 2 phases. 
					</li>
					<li>
						The first phase was developed using <i>Spring MVC </i> and <i>MySQL</i>.
					</li>
					<li>
						The second phase was developed using <i>Spring Hibernate</i> and <i>MongoDB</i>.
					</li>
					<li>
						In each phase users were authorized through JWT Token and REST API 
						were tested using Postman.

					<li>
						This was a machine learning project which is hosted on kaggle every year
						to predict winner for the upcoming tournament based on historical dataset.
					</li>
					<li>
						In this project the accuracy of model is tested by predicting probabilities 
						for every possible matchup in the past 4 NCAA tournaments (2014-2017).
					</li>
					<li>
						The goal of the competition is to build and test the models based
						on past data, call out the probabilities and predict the result.
					</li>
					<li>
						This projects evaluation is based on the <i>Minimum Log Loss</i>
						and the accuracy score obtained by different Classifiers
						applied

						<li>
							Business professionals considered for this project are
							charted accountant, doctors, plumbers and mechanics.
						</li>
						<li>
							The idea is implemented using android.
